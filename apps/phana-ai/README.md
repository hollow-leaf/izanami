</div>

The RedPill AI Agent template is a **MINIMAL** template to build an AI Agent that can be hosted on Phala Network's decentralized hosting protocol. Unlike Vercel or other FaaS, it allows you to publish your AI Agent compiled code to IPFS and hosts it on a fully decentralized FaaS cloud with the following benefits:

- 💨 Ship Fast: Build and ship with familiar toolchain in minutes
- ⛑️ Secure: Execution guarded by rock solid TEE / Intel SGX
- 🔒 Private: Host API keys and user privacy at ease
- 💎 Unstoppable: Powered by IPFS and Phala's 35k+ decentralized TEE workers
- :fire: [**hono/tiny** Support](https://hono.dev/docs/api/presets#hono-tiny): a small, simple, and ultrafast web framework built on Web Standards.
- 🧪: [Vite Test Framework](https://vitest.dev/guide/): Vite Testing Framework support, but your free to change the test framework to your desire.

> **NOTICE**
>
> We recommend using @hono/tiny to avoid a large bundle size and the 20MB final artifact limitation.

## Getting Started
### Prepare
Install dependencies
```shell
npm install
```

### Testing Locally
Create `.env` file with the default ThirdWeb API key for publishing your Agent Contract to IPFS
```shell
cp .env.example .env
```
Get an API Key from Redpill
> **Note**
> 
> There is a default RedPill API Key provided in the .env.example file. This API key is rate limited and if you run into an error that displays `Insufficient funds`, reach out to the Phala Team on [discord](https://discord.gg/phala-network).

- Go to https://red-pill.ai/dashboard and claim your API Key by swapping some ETH for wGPT at https://app.uniswap.org/explore/tokens/base/0x74F62Bc1961028C22b8080961c6534f4eDD49D6C
- Video Tutorial: https://youtu.be/ZoJwbLNhbWE

In [default.json](./secrets/default.json) file replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your API Key. The default has a rate limit. If you want access to a RedPill code, reach out to the Phala Team.
```text
{
  "apiKey": "YOUR_REDPILL_API_KEY"
}
```

Build your Agent
```shell
npm run build
```

Test your Agent locally
```shell
npm run test
```

Expected Test Results
```shell
Now you are ready to publish your agent, add secrets, and interact with your agent in the following steps:
- Execute: 'npm run publish-agent'
- Set secrets: 'npm run set-secrets'
- Go to the url produced by setting the secrets (e.g. https://wapo-testnet.phala.network/ipfs/QmPQJD5zv3cYDRM25uGAVjLvXGNyQf9Vonz7rqkQB52Jae?key=b092532592cbd0cf)

   Duration  6.36s (transform 23ms, setup 6ms, collect 31ms, tests 6.16s, environment 0ms, prepare 39ms)
```

### Publish Your AI Agent

Upload your compiled AI Agent code to IPFS.
```shell
npm run publish-agent
```

Upon a successful upload, the command should show the URL to access your AI Agent.
```shell
- Uploading file to IPFS. This may take a while depending on file sizes.

✔ Successfully uploaded file to IPFS.
✔ Files stored at the following IPFS URI: ipfs://QmaUbZgNz9dZ5eGm87DDqegRtcBV7RdosxizYQcfe2bHRc
✔ Open this link to view your upload: https://b805a9b72767504353244e0422c2b5f9.ipfscdn.io/ipfs/bafybeifukvkuyztltpq2gi55nswzvwkpgrwrogwykm4ymoqeymh2pxoukm/

Agent Contract deployed at: https://wapo-testnet.phala.network/ipfs/QmaUbZgNz9dZ5eGm87DDqegRtcBV7RdosxizYQcfe2bHRc

If your agent requires secrets, ensure to do the following:
1) Edit the ./secrets/default.json file or create a new JSON file in the ./secrets folder and add your secrets to it.
2) Run command: 'npm run set-secrets' or 'npm run set-secrets [path-to-json-file]'
Logs folder created.
Deployment information updated in ./logs/latestDeployment.json
```


> :information_source: Note that your latest deployment information will be logged to in file [`./logs/latestDeployment.json`](./logs/latestDeployment.json). This file is updated every time you publish a new Agent Contract to IPFS. This file is also used to get the IPFS CID of your Agent Contract when setting secrets for your Agent Contract.
>
> Here is an example:
> ```json
> {
>   "date": "2024-08-29T18:47:55.108Z",
>   "cid": "QmaUbZgNz9dZ5eGm87DDqegRtcBV7RdosxizYQcfe2bHRc",
>   "url": "https://wapo-testnet.phala.network/ipfs/QmaUbZgNz9dZ5eGm87DDqegRtcBV7RdosxizYQcfe2bHRc"
> }
> ```

<details>
<summary>New to Thirdweb?</summary>
We use <a href="https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/infrastructure/storage">thirdweb Storage</a> to host IPFS contents. If you are new to thirdweb, the command will guide you to create your account or login to your existing account from the browser.
</details>

> **Did Thirdweb fail to publish?**
>
> If ThirdWeb fails to publish, please signup for your own ThirdWeb account to publish your Agent Contract to IPFS. Signup or login at https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/
>
> Whenever you log into ThirdWeb, create a new API key and replace the default API Key with yours in the [.env](./.env) file.
>
> ```
> THIRDWEB_API_KEY="YOUR_THIRDWEB_API_KEY"
> ```


### Access the Published AI Agent

Once published, your AI Agent is available at the URL: `https://wapo-testnet.phala.network/ipfs/<your-cid>`. You can get it from the "Publish to IPFS" step.

You can test it with `curl`.

```bash
curl https://wapo-testnet.phala.network/ipfs/<your-cid>
```

### Add Secrets

By default, all the compiled JS code is visible for anyone to view if they look at IPFS CID. This makes private info like API keys, signer keys, etc. vulnerable to be stolen. To protect devs from leaking keys, we have added a field called `secret` in the `Request` object. It allows you to store secrets in a vault for your AI Agent to access.

To add your secrets,
1) Edit the [default.json](./secrets/default.json) file or create a new JSON file in the `./secrets` folder and add your secrets to it.
```json
{
  "apiKey": "YOUR_REDPILL_API_KEY"
}
```
2) Run command to set the secrets
```shell
npm run set-secrets
# or if you have a custom JSON file
npm run set-secrets <path-to-json-file>
```
Expected output:
```shell
Use default secrets...
Storing secrets...
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   199    0    68  100   131    121    234 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   356
{"token":"5d9faaed6be5414a","key":"a3a8a4ef2c057d5c","succeed":true}

Secrets set successfully. Go to the URL below to interact with your agent:
https://wapo-testnet.phala.network/ipfs/QmaUbZgNz9dZ5eGm87DDqegRtcBV7RdosxizYQcfe2bHRc?key=a3a8a4ef2c057d5c
Log entry added to secrets.log
```

> :information_source: Note that all your secrets will be logged in file [`./logs/secrets.log`](./logs/secrets.log). This file is updated every time you add new secrets to your Agent Contract. If you have not published an Agent Contract, yet, this command will fail since there is not a CID to map the secrets to.
>
> Here is an example:
> ```text
> 2024-08-29T18:54:16.643Z, CID: [QmaUbZgNz9dZ5eGm87DDqegRtcBV7RdosxizYQcfe2bHRc], Token: [5d9faaed6be5414a], Key: [a3a8a4ef2c057d5c], URL: [https://wapo-testnet.phala.network/ipfs/QmaUbZgNz9dZ5eGm87DDqegRtcBV7RdosxizYQcfe2bHRc?key=a3a8a4ef2c057d5c]
> ```

The API returns a `token` and a `key`. The `key` is the id of your secret. It can be used to specify which secret you are going to pass to your frame. The `token` can be used by the developer to access the raw secret. You should never leak the `token`.

To verify the secret, run the following command where `key` and `token` are replaced with the values from adding your `secret` to the vault.
```shell
curl https://wapo-testnet.phala.network/vaults/<key>/<token>
```

Expected output:
```shell
{"data":{"apiKey":"<REDPILL_API_KEY>"},"succeed":true}
```

#### Accessing Secrets in Your Code
To access your secrets you will have to get them from secret `vault` via `process.env.secret`. Here is an example of accessing the secret key value of `apiKey`.
```typescript
let vault: Record<string, string> = {}
try {
  vault = JSON.parse(process.env.secret || '')
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e)
  return c.json({ error: "Failed to parse secrets" })
}
const apiKey = (vault.apiKey) ? vault.apiKey as string : 'SALTY_BAE'
```

### Handling Requests
Check the [`Hono` docs](https://hono.dev/docs) for information on accessing URL `queries` or `body` from a `post` request.

> **NOTICE**
>
> We recommend using @hono/tiny to avoid a large bundle size and the 20MB final artifact limitation.

```typescript
// Access query value for a URL query named `type`
let queries = c.req.queries() || {}
const getType = (queries.type) ? queries.type[0] as string : ''
// Access body from post request
const data = await c.req.json()
```

### Debugging

To debug your agent, you can use the following command:
```shell
curl https://wapo-testnet.phala.network/logs/all/ipfs/<CID>
```

After executing this command then you should see some output in the terminal to show the logs of requests to your agent.
```shell
