### **What is Izanami?**

Izanami is an innovative address analysis tool that combines AI and community-driven insights. It helps you evaluate and understand social interactions with ease and precision.

Using a large language model (LLM), users are grouped into categories based on multiple dimensions. All data, including evaluations and historical information, is securely stored on the blockchain and encrypted. Only the user can decrypt their identity, while group voting enables users to engage in discussions or decisions with a unique social persona. This persona, verified and recognized by the community, may change after each social interaction.

The system allows users to express different aspects of their personality in various social contexts. For example, an introverted person who actively votes in an outdoor activity might have their vote carry more weight. Conversely, an extrovert contributing to solitary challenges can demonstrate the toolâ€™s value.

Overall, Izanami provides a way for users to showcase multiple facets of their personality in different social scenarios, all within a secure and decentralized framework.
